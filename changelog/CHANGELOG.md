# @goodware/mysql Release History

## 5.1.1 2023-05-16

Update documentation

## 5.1.0 2023-05-15

Use @aws-sdk/rds-signer RDS IAM login. This is no longer an optional dependency, which isn't as bad now that the SDK has been broken down into smaller pieces.

## 5.0.5 2022-09-07

Update documentation

## 5.0.4 2022-05-14

Roll back previous change. Do not allow ssl to be an empty string. mysql2 doesn't allow it.

## 5.0.3 2022-05-10

Allow ssl to be an empty string

## 5.0.0 - 5.0.1 2022-05-09

### Breaking Changes

- Do not default ssl to 'Amazon RDS' when ssl isn't provided

This fixes an issue particularly for AWS China where ssl is not supported by IAM passwordless login. In other words, for the constructor options, `useIAM` is `true` and ssl is unspecified. In previous releases, ssl was automatically set to Amazon RDS when useIAM was specified.

### Other Changes

- Add aws-sdk 2.0 as a dependency (no longer optional)

## 4.0.0 - 4.0.5 2022-03-26
